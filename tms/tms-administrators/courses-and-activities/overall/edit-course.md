# When can I edit a course?

Courses created by an organization are open for editing to users with course creation permissions. All fields, activities, and settings can be edited before any training events use the course. Once a class or a course assignment has started, the course fields available for editing are limited for the life of the course. This limitation is in place to meet with Learn on Demand Systems billing procedure.

Editing a course profile is restricted when training aligned with the course is in progress. From the time a class or course assignments starts editing of the related course profile is restricted to the following:
* Course name
* Short name 
* Version
* Description
* HTML Description
* Auto Archive
* Archive

If you edit a course after any training has started, a message displays stating: This course has been used for a class or a course assignment and some fields cannot be changed. If you need to update the content, we recommend using the **Save As** button to BROKEN [clone the course](/tms/tms-administratots/courses-and-activities/overall/clone-course.md) creating a new version of the course for future deliveries.

To access all course features for editing, edit the course and select the **Save As** button. This creates a duplicate course profile and opens a dialog box to name the new course. The new course has all fields, activities, and settings open for editing; it can be updated and saved. Future deliveries of classes and course assignments can be created using the new course profile.

Changes needed for a class in progress can be made by cloning the course and making the needed changes. The BROKEN [class in progress can also be cloned] (/tms/tms-administrators/classes/schedule/clone-class.md), the course changed to the new course and saved. On the roster you can use the **Add Students from Event** link to choose the original class and add all those students as enrolled. 

In order to not be invoiced for enrollments from a class in progress that was replaced by a new class using the new course, _you are required to contact Learn on Demand Systems Support the first day of class._ We can cancel the class session on your behalf. Requesting cancellation of classes beyond the first day of a class or beyond course assignmentâ€™s creation date requires approval by your Account Executive.

If you need assistance setting up a new course or class, please contact [LODS Support](http://www.learnondemandsystems.com/customer-support/)
